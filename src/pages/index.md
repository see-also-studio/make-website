          Hidden away among the beanstalks and leafy greens of the Story Garden
          in Camden, MAKE is a community studio where you can explore creative
          collaboration and projects by the local community. MAKE embraces the
          skills and talents of people who live work and study in Somers Town
          and St Pancras as well as the wider Camden area.


          Always evolving, MAKE opened in July 2019 with Central Saint Martins (CSM) providing the expertise and know-how to launch this creative community space and turn the idea into a reality. Since spring 2021, MAKE is now run by the Somers Town Community Association and the St Pancras & Somers Town Living Centre.

          MAKE brings together lots of different groups of people from our local
          communities, with a shared focus on creating, making and sharing
          ideas.


          Whether it’s individuals who live and work locally in Somers Town and St Pancras, students and staff from our neighbours at CSM, or other local organisations, MAKE is a space where people from many different backgrounds can come together to create and learn from each other.

          MAKE offers a creative space where our vibrant local community can get
          together to address local issues and social challenges in a creative
          and practical way by getting involved in creative  and cultural
          experiences.


          Making clothes, repairing furniture, working with clay, weaving textiles or running art activities about tackling the climate emergency… These are just a few of the projects and workshops that have run at MAKE.

          MAKE is a studio and creative workshop located  within the Story
          Garden – a temporary garden run by the charity Global Generation on a
          site owned by the British Library.


          The physical space comprises two spaces, built from reused shipping containers, offering specialist equipment.


          It is open to booking by community groups, organisations and residents within the area.

          As well as the public studio space itself, MAKE can provide inspiration for possible projects, including know-how gained from past experience, and practical support to make creative ideas come to life.
