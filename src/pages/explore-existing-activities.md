          Once you get a better sense of how you’d like to use MAKE, you can
          download our Activity proposal form.


          We ask all individuals, community organisations, project partners, and any other groups to fill in a proposal form for any projects and activities they’d like to run at MAKE @ Story Garden.


          This form ensures that your project/activities meets the overall principles of MAKE @ Story Garden as a community-centred space and is compatible with our resources.


          By filling in the form this also helps us to match you with facilitators who might be able to support you and/or with local people who might benefit from your activity.


          Once we’ve received your proposal we’ll be in touch to organise a time for you to come to MAKE and discuss your proposal.

          Welcome to MAKE’s Activity Library.


          Below are a series of cards that outline projects, activities and workshops delivered at MAKE.


          We hope these might inspire you and help when you fill in the activity proposal form. We also think these could help connect local projects and people and help catalyse new ideas!


          Some of the cards have their own downloadable workshop guides and technical files for you to use independently at MAKE.


          Click on each card to find out more about the specifics.
