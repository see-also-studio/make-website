          We ask all individuals, community organisations, project partners, and
          any other groups to fill in a proposal form for any projects and
          activities they’d like to run at MAKE @ Story Garden. 


          This form ensures that your project/activities meets the overall principles of MAKE @ Story Garden as a community-centred space and is compatible with our resources.


          By filling in the form this also helps us to match you with facilitators who might be able to support you and/or with local people who might benefit from your activity. 


          Once we’ve received your proposal we’ll be in touch to organise a time for you to come to MAKE and discuss your proposal.
