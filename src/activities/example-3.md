        content: "*MAKE a Stool* invites participants to craft their own unique piece of
          wooden furniture. Following a simple archetypal template, they will
          transform raw materials into a solid finished product using only
          traditional woodworking techniques. The activity aims to provide
          participants with an essential understanding of hand tools and covers
          some of the fundamentals of woodworking knowledge that will help build
          experience, confidence and skill to be taken forward into more
          ambitious projects."
