          Clay Social is a clay workshop for people of all ages and levels of
          experience. The core value is to connect people with one another and
          improve wellbeing and interpersonal skills through making and
          material. Exercises and tasks are introduced to help people to think
          about clay to express themselves and respond to their environment.


          As the sessions move on, participants will learn the inherent skills of ceramics as they learn about basic construction skills, glazing and firing in a raku kiln.
