        content: MAKE Social is a series of online workshops to connect, share ideas and
          improve craft skills in the home. This ongoing programme supports the
          community of makers, residents and associates of MAKE who may not
          access the physical site due to mobility issues, distance or under
          lockdowns as experienced during covid19. Access to makers homes
          through remote learning can improve confidence and mental wellbeing
          through guided discussion and support in realising their creative
          ideas.
